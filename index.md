## Outline

Just as Big Data has revolutionised the way data is managed across industries, it has begun to make significant changes in Health and Medicine, leading to reductions in costs of treatment, improved diagnosis, predicting outbreaks, prevention of disease, and improving the quality of life. For instance, 94% of the hospitals in the US have adopted the use of Electronic Health Records, which according to a McKinsey report, has “improved outcomes in cardiovascular disease and achieved an estimated $1 billion in savings from reduced office visits and lab tests”. Using Big Data Analytics in Health and Medicine can further optimise the process a patient goes through, further democratise access to specialised healthcare and reduce costs.

This workshop will focus on the cutting-edge developments from both academia and industry, with a particular emphasis on novel techniques to capture, store and process big data from a wide range of sources to improve health and medicine, and in particular on the methodologies and technologies which can be applied to correlate, learn and mine, interpret and visualise data which will improve health and medical processes.

This workshop is timely and interesting for researchers, academics and practitioners in big data processing and analytics and health and medicine. The workshop is very relevant to the big data community, especially data mining, machine learning, cyber-physical systems, and computational intelligence. It will bring forth a lively forum on this exciting and challenging area at the conference.
